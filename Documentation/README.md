# MeshRF Documentation

Welcome to the MeshRF Documentation site. MeshRF is a powerful web-based toolset designed for RF planning, terrain analysis, and network optimization.

## Core Tools

- [**Link Analyzer**](./link-analyzer.md) - Point-to-point link budget and Fresnel zone analysis.
- [**Viewshed**](./viewshed.md) - Optical line-of-sight analysis using terrain data.
- [**RF Simulator**](./rf-simulator.md) - Radio propagation heatmaps and coverage analysis.
- [**Elevation Scan**](./elevation-scan.md) - Rapid terrain analysis to find ideal transmitter locations.
- [**Hardware Settings**](./hardware-settings.md) - Detailed guide on devices, antennas, and radio presets.
- [**Batch Processing**](./batch-processing.md) - Bulk analysis and mesh report generation via CSV.

## Getting Started

1. **Select a Tool**: Use the toolbar at the top of the map to select your analysis mode.
2. **Interact with the Map**: Click, drag, and drop markers to define your locations.
3. **Analyze Results**: View real-time charts, heatmaps, and stats panels.

## How it Works

MeshRF combines high-resolution terrain data (DEM) with specialized RF propagation models (Free Space Path Loss, Okumura-Hata) to provide accurate predictions for wireless network performance.
