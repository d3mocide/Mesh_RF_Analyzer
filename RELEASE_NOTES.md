# Release v1.14.1: Multi-Site UI Cleanup

This minor release focuses on cleaning up the visual presentation of the **Multi-Site Analysis** tool. By removing redundant visual layers, we've made the link topology graph much easier to read and analyze.

## Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

### 1. Removed "Purple Box" Shadows

The solid purple background rendered for obstructed areas in candidate sites has been removed. This was previously making the map appear cluttered and "heavy". The maps are now back to their clean, sci-fi aesthetic.

### 2. Streamlined Coverage Footprints

We've removed the green "composite coverage" footprints from the Multi-Site analysis view. While useful for single-site scans, they were creating significant visual noise in multi-site mesh planning. The focus is now purely on the **Inter-Site Link Topology** and the data in the results panel.
