# Release v1.15.2: Mobile Polish & UI Refinements

This patch release focuses on optimizing the mobile experience and refining the user interface to maximize screen real estate and usability.

## 📱 Mobile Experience

### Layout Optimizations

- **Viewshed Control Panel**: Now correctly anchored to the bottom of the screen on mobile devices, ensuring easy access without blocking the map view.
- **Guidance Overlays**: Repositioned to the top of the screen on mobile to avoid overlapping with bottom controls, with adjusted spacing to clear the top toolbar.
- **Advanced RF Settings**: The floating settings box has been moved (offset `190px` from bottom) to sit perfectly above the main control panel.

## 🎨 UI Refinements

### Compact Controls

- **Greedy Optimization**: The "Greedy Optimization" toggle in the Multi-Site Manager has been redesigned into a compact, single-line control. This reduces visual clutter and provides more room for the node list.

### Documentation

- **Accuracy**: Fixed a typo in the Viewshed guidance text to correctly refer to the visible area as "Purple" instead of "Green".
